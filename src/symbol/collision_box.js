/**
 * A collision box represents an area of the map that that is covered by a
 * label. CollisionFeature uses one or more of these collision boxes to
 * represent all the area covered by a single label. They are used to
 * prevent collisions between labels.
 *
 * A collision box actually represents a 3d volume. The first two dimensions,
 * x and y, are specified with `anchor` along with `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`.
 * The third dimension, zoom, is limited by `maxScale` which determines
 * how far in the z dimensions the box extends.
 *
 * As you zoom in on a map, all points on the map get further and further apart
 * but labels stay roughly the same size. Labels cover less real world area on
 * the map at higher zoom levels than they do at lower zoom levels. This is why
 * areas are are represented with an anchor point and offsets from that point
 * instead of just using four absolute points.
 *
 * Line labels are represented by a set of these boxes spaced out along a line.
 * When you zoom in, line labels cover less real world distance along the line
 * than they used to. Collision boxes near the edges that used to cover label
 * no longer do. If a box doesn't cover the label anymore it should be ignored
 * when doing collision checks. `maxScale` is how much you can scale the map
 * before the label isn't within the box anymore.
 * For example
 * lower zoom:

 * slightly higher zoom:

 * In the zoomed in image the two grey boxes on either side don't cover the
 * label anymore. Their maxScale is smaller than the current scale.
