## 0.10.0 (Aug 21 2015)

#### Breaking changes

* Switched to [longitude, latitude] coordinate order, matching GeoJSON. We anticipate that mapbox-gl-js will be widely used
  with GeoJSON, and in the long term having a coordinate order that is consistent with GeoJSON will lead to less confusion
  and impedance mismatch than will a [latitude, longitude] order.

  The following APIs were renamed:

    * `LatLng` was renamed to `LngLat`
    * `LatLngBounds` was renamed to `LngLatBounds`
    * `Popup#setLatLng` was renamed to `Popup#setLngLat`
    * `Popup#getLatLng` was renamed to `Popup#getLngLat`
    * The `latLng` property of Map events was renamed `lngLat`

  The following APIs now expect array coordinates in [longitude, latitude] order:

    * `LngLat.convert`
    * `LngLatBounds.convert`
    * `Popup#setLngLat`
    * The `center` and `maxBounds` options of the `Map` constructor
    * The arguments to `Map#setCenter`, `Map#fitBounds`, `Map#panTo`, and `Map#project`
    * The `center` option of `Map#jumpTo`, `Map#easeTo`, and `Map#flyTo`
    * The `around` option of `Map#zoomTo`, `Map#rotateTo`, and `Map#easeTo`
    * The `coordinates` properties of video and image sources

* Updated to mapbox-gl-style-spec v8.0.0 ([Changelog](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-style-spec/blob/v8.0.0/CHANGELOG.md)). Styles are
  now expected to be version 8. You can use the [gl-style-migrate](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-style-lint#migrations)
  utility to update existing styles.

* The format for `mapbox://` style and glyphs URLs has changed. For style URLs, you should now use the format
  `mapbox://styles/:username/:style`. The `:style` portion of the URL no longer contains a username. For font URLs, you
  should now use the format `mapbox://fonts/:username/{fontstack}/{range}.pbf`.
* Mapbox default styles are now hosted via the Styles API rather than www.mapbox.com. You can make use of the Styles API
  with a `mapbox://` style URL pointing to a v8 style, e.g. `mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v8`.
* The v8 satellite style (`mapbox://styles/mapbox/satellite-v8`) is now a plain satellite style, and not longer supports labels
  or contour lines via classes. For a labeled satellite style, use `mapbox://styles/mapbox/satellite-hybrid`.

* Removed `mbgl.config.HTTP_URL` and `mbgl.config.FORCE_HTTPS`; https is always used when connecting to the Mapbox API.
* Renamed `mbgl.config.HTTPS_URL` to `mbgl.config.API_URL`.

#### Bugfixes

* Don't draw halo when halo-width is 0 (#1381)
* Reverted shader changes that degraded performance on IE

#### API Improvements

* You can now unset layout and paint properties via the `setLayoutProperty` and `setPaintProperty` APIs
  by passing `undefined` as a property value.
* The `layer` option of `featuresAt` now supports an array of layers.

## 0.9.0 (Jul 29 2015)

* `glyphs` URL now normalizes without the `/v4/` prefix for `mapbox://` urls. Legacy behavior for `mapbox://fontstacks` is still maintained (#1385)
* Expose `geojson-vt` options for GeoJSON sources (#1271)
* bearing snaps to "North" within a tolerance of 7 degrees (#1059)
* Now you can directly mutate the minzoom and maxzoom layer properties with `map.setLayerZoomRange(layerId, minzoom, maxzoom)`
* Exposed `mapboxgl.Control`, a base class used by all UI controls
* Refactored handlers to be individually included in Map options, or enable/disable them individually at runtime, e.g. `map.scrollZoom.disable()`.
* New feature: Batch operations can now be done at once, improving performance for calling multiple style functions: (#1352)

  ```js
  style.batch(function(s) {
      s.addLayer({ id: 'first', type: 'symbol', source: 'streets' });
      s.addLayer({ id: 'second', type: 'symbol', source: 'streets' });
      s.addLayer({ id: 'third', type: 'symbol', source: 'terrain' });
      s.setPaintProperty('first', 'text-color', 'black');
      s.setPaintProperty('first', 'text-halo-color', 'white');
  });
  ```

## 0.8.1 (Jun 16 2015)

* No code changes; released only to correct a build issue in 0.8.0.

## 0.8.0 (Jun 15 2015)

#### Breaking changes

* `map.setView(latlng, zoom, bearing)` has been removed. Use
  [`map.jumpTo(options)`](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#map/jumpto) instead:

  ```js
  map.setView([40, -74.50], 9) // 0.7.0 or earlier
  map.jumpTo({center: [40, -74.50], zoom: 9}); // now
  ```
* [`map.easeTo`](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#map/easeto) and
  [`map.flyTo`](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#map/flyto) now accept a single
  options object rather than positional parameters:

  ```js
  map.easeTo([40, -74.50], 9, null, {duration: 400}); // 0.7.0 or earlier
  map.easeTo({center: [40, -74.50], zoom: 9, duration: 400}); // now
  ```
* `mapboxgl.Source` is no longer exported. Use `map.addSource()` instead. See the
  [GeoJSON line](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/geojson-line/) or
  [GeoJSON markers](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/geojson-markers/)
  examples.

## 0.2.2 (Aug 12 2014)

#### Breaking

- `map.setBearing()` no longer supports a second argument. Use `map.rotateTo` with an `offset` option and duration 0
if you need to rotate around a point other than the map center.

#### Improvements

- Improved `GeoJSONSource` to also accept URL as `data` option, eliminating a huge performance bottleneck in case of large GeoJSON files.
[#669](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/669) [#671](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/671)
- Switched to a different fill outlines rendering approach. [#668](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/668)
- Made the minified build 12% smaller gzipped (66 KB now).
- Added `around` option to `Map` `zoomTo`/`rotateTo`.
- Made the permalink hash more compact.
- Bevel linejoins no longer overlap and look much better when drawn with transparency.

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed the **broken minified build**. [#679](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/679)
- Fixed **blurry icons** rendering. [#666](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/666)
- Fixed `util.supports` WebGL detection producing false positives in some cases. [#677](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/677)
- Fixed invalid font configuration completely blocking tile rendering.  [#662](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/662)

- Updated CSS classes to have consistent naming prefixed with `mapboxgl-`.

#### Improvements

- Added attribution control (present by default, disable by passing `attributionControl: false` in options).
