## 0.6.0 (Feb 9 2015)

#### Bugfixes

* Clear color buffers before rendering (#966)
* Make line-opacity work with line-image (#970)
* event.toElement fallback for Firefox (#932)

* Switch to ESLint and more strict code rules (#957)
* Grab 2x raster tiles if retina (#754)
* Support for mapbox:// style URLs (#875)

#### Breaking

* Updated to mapbox-gl-style-spec v7.0.0 ([Changelog](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-style-spec/blob/a2b0b561ce16015a1ef400dc870326b1b5255091/CHANGELOG.md)). Styles are
  now expected to be version 7. You can use the [gl-style-migrate](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-style-lint#migrations)
  utility to update existing styles.
* HTTP_URL and HTTPS_URL config options must no longer include a `/v4` path prefix.
* `addClass`, `removeClass`, `setClasses`, `hasClass`, and `getClasses` are now methods
  on Map.

* The format for `featuresAt` results changed. Instead of result-per-geometry-cross-layer,
  each result has a `layers` array with all layers that contain the feature. This avoids
  duplication of geometry and properties in the result set.

  source.add, source.remove, source.load, source.error, source.change,
  tile.add, tile.remove, tile.load, tile.error
* Vastly improved performance and correctness for GeoJSON sources
* Map#setStyle accepts a style URL
* Support {prefix} in tile URL templates
* Provide a source map with minified source

#### Breaking

* Results format for `featuresAt` changed

## 0.2.2 (Aug 12 2014)

if you need to rotate around a point other than the map center.

#### Improvements

- Improved `GeoJSONSource` to also accept URL as `data` option, eliminating a huge performance bottleneck in case of large GeoJSON files.
[#669](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/669) [#671](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/671)
- Switched to a different fill outlines rendering approach. [#668](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/668)
- Made the minified build 12% smaller gzipped (66 KB now).
- Added `around` option to `Map` `zoomTo`/`rotateTo`.
- Made the permalink hash more compact.

- Fixed **blurry icons** rendering. [#666](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/666)
- Fixed `util.supports` WebGL detection producing false positives in some cases. [#677](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/677)

- Fixed sprite loading race condition. [#593](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/593)

## 0.2.1 (Aug 8 2014)

#### Breaking

- Changed `Navigation` control signature: now it doesn't need `map` in constructor
and gets added with `map.addControl(nav)` or `nav.addTo(map)`.
