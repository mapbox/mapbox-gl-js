## 1.0.0

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking changes

This release replaces the existing ‚Äúmap views‚Äù pricing model in favor of a ‚Äúmap load‚Äù model. Learn more in [a recent blog post about these changes](https://blog.mapbox.com/new-pricing-46b7c26166e7).

**By upgrading to this release, you are opting in to the new map loads pricing.**

**Why is this change being made?**

This change allows us to implement a more standardized and predictable method of billing GL JS map usage. You‚Äôll be charged whenever your website or web application loads, not by when users pan and zoom around the map, incentivizing developers to create highly interactive map experiences. The new pricing structure also creates a significantly larger free tier to help developers get started building their applications with Mapbox tools while pay-as-you-go pricing and automatic volume discounts help your application scale with Mapbox. Session billing also aligns invoices with metrics web developers already track and makes it easier to compare usage with other mapping providers.

**What is changing?**
- Add SKU token to Mapbox API requests [#8276](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/pull/8276)

When (and only when) loading tiles from a Mapbox API with a Mapbox access token set (`mapboxgl.accessToken`), a query parameter named `sku` will be added to all requests for vector, raster and raster-dem tiles. Every map instance uses a unique `sku` value, which is refreshed every 12 hours. The token itself is comprised of a token version (always ‚Äú1‚Äù), a sku ID (always ‚Äú01‚Äù) and a random 10-digit base-62 number. The purpose of the token is to allow for metering of map sessions on the server-side. A session lasts from a new map instantiation until the map is destroyed or 12 hours passes, whichever comes first.

For further information on the pricing changes, you can read our [blog post](https://blog.mapbox.com/new-pricing-46b7c26166e7) and check out our new [pricing page](https://www.mapbox.com/pricing), which has a price calculator. As always, you can also contact our team at [https://support.mapbox.com](https://support.mapbox.com).

- A [heatmap](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/heatmap-layer/) layer type is now available. This layer type allows you to visualize and explore massive datasets of points, reflecting the shape and density of data well while also looking beautiful.

  ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Dme5MAgdA3pYdTRHUQzvLw.png)
- The value of a style property or filter can now be an [expression](http://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/#expressions). Expressions are a way of doing data-driven and zoom-driven styling that provides more flexibility and control, and unifies property and filter syntax.

  Previously, data-driven and zoom-driven styling relied on stop functions: you specify a feature property and a set of input-output pairs that essentially define a ‚Äúscale‚Äù for how the style should be calculated based on the feature property. For example, the following would set circle colors on a green-to-red scale based on the value of `feature.properties.population`:

  ```
  "circle-color": {
    "property": "population",
    "stops": [
      [0, "green"],
      [1000000, "red"]
    ]
  }
  ```

  This approach is powerful, but we‚Äôve seen a number of use cases that stop functions don't satisfy. Expressions provide the flexibility to address use cases like these:

  **Multiple feature properties**
  Using more than one feature property to calculate a given style property. E.g., styling land polygon colors based on both `feature.properties.land_use_category` and `feature.properties.elevation`.

  **Arithmetic**
  For some use cases it‚Äôs necessary to do some arithmetic on the input data. One example is sizing circles to represent quantitative data. Since a circle‚Äôs visual size on the screen is really its area (and A=œÄr^2), the right way to scale `circle-radius` is `square_root(feature.properties.input_data_value)`. Another example is unit conversions: feature data may include properties that are in some particular unit. Displaying such data in units appropriate to, say, a user‚Äôs preference or location, requires being able to do simple arithmetic (multiplication, division) on whatever value is in the data.

  **Conditional logic**
  This is a big one: basic if-then logic, for example to decide exactly what text to display for a label based on which properties are available in the feature or even the length of the name. A key example of this is properly supporting bilingual labels, where we have to decide whether to show local + English, local-only, or English-only, based on the data that‚Äôs available for each feature.

  **String manipulation**
  More dynamic control over label text with things like uppercase/lowercase/title case transforms, localized number formatting, etc. Without this functionality, crafting and iterating on label content entails a large data-prep burden.

  **Filters**
  Style layer filters had similar limitations. Moreover, they use a different syntax, even though their job is very similar to that of data-driven styling functions: filters say, ‚Äúhere‚Äôs how to look at a feature and decide whether to draw it,‚Äù and data-driven style functions say, ‚Äúhere‚Äôs how to look at a feature and decide how to size/color/place it.‚Äù Expressions provide a unified syntax for defining parts of a style that need to be calculated dynamically from feature data.

  For information on the syntax and behavior of expressions, please see [the documentation](http://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/#expressions).

### :wrench: Development workflow improvements
- Add (and now require) Flow type annotations throughout the majority of the codebase.
- Migrate to CircleCI 2.0 [#4939](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/pull/4939)


## 0.39.1 (July 24, 2017)

### :bug: Bug fixes
- Fix packaging issue in 0.39.0 [#5025](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/5025)
- Correctly evaluate enum-based identity functions [#5023](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/5023)

## 0.39.0 (July 21, 2017)

### :warning: Breaking changes

- `GeolocateControl` breaking changes #4479
  * The option `watchPosition` has been replaced with `trackUserLocation`
  * The camera operation has changed from `jumpTo` (not animated) to `fitBounds` (animated). An effect of this is the map pitch is no longer reset, although the bearing is still reset to 0.
  * The accuracy of the geolocation provided by the device is used to set the view (previously it was fixed at zoom level 17). The `maxZoom` can be controlled via the new `fitBoundsOptions` option (defaults to 15).
- Anchor `Marker`s at their center by default #5019 @andrewharvey
- Increase `significantRotateThreshold` for the `TouchZoomRotateHandler` #4971, @dagjomar

### :sparkles: Features and improvements

- Add user location tracking capability to `GeolocateControl` #4479, @andrewharvey
  * New option `showUserLocation` to draw a "dot" as a `Marker` on the map at the user's location
  * An active lock and background state are introduced with `trackUserLocation`. When in active lock the camera will update to follow the user location, however if the camera is changed by the API or UI then the control will enter the background state where it won't update the camera to follow the user location.
  * New option `fitBoundsOptions` to control the camera operation
  * New `trackuserlocationstart` and `trackuserlocationend` events
  * New `LngLat.toBounds` method to extend a point location by a given radius to a `LngLatBounds` object

## 0.10.0 (Aug 21 2015)

#### Breaking changes

* Switched to [longitude, latitude] coordinate order, matching GeoJSON. We anticipate that mapbox-gl-js will be widely used
  with GeoJSON, and in the long term having a coordinate order that is consistent with GeoJSON will lead to less confusion
  and impedance mismatch than will a [latitude, longitude] order.

  The following APIs were renamed:

    * `LatLng` was renamed to `LngLat`
    * `LatLngBounds` was renamed to `LngLatBounds`
    * `Popup#setLatLng` was renamed to `Popup#setLngLat`
    * `Popup#getLatLng` was renamed to `Popup#getLngLat`
    * The `latLng` property of Map events was renamed `lngLat`

  The following APIs now expect array coordinates in [longitude, latitude] order:

    * `LngLat.convert`
    * `LngLatBounds.convert`
    * `Popup#setLngLat`
    * The `center` and `maxBounds` options of the `Map` constructor
    * The arguments to `Map#setCenter`, `Map#fitBounds`, `Map#panTo`, and `Map#project`
    * The `center` option of `Map#jumpTo`, `Map#easeTo`, and `Map#flyTo`
    * The `around` option of `Map#zoomTo`, `Map#rotateTo`, and `Map#easeTo`
    * The `coordinates` properties of video and image sources

* Updated to mapbox-gl-style-spec v8.0.0 ([Changelog](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-style-spec/blob/v8.0.0/CHANGELOG.md)). Styles are
  now expected to be version 8. You can use the [gl-style-migrate](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-style-lint#migrations)
  utility to update existing styles.

* The format for `mapbox://` style and glyphs URLs has changed. For style URLs, you should now use the format
  `mapbox://styles/:username/:style`. The `:style` portion of the URL no longer contains a username. For font URLs, you
  should now use the format `mapbox://fonts/:username/{fontstack}/{range}.pbf`.
* Mapbox default styles are now hosted via the Styles API rather than www.mapbox.com. You can make use of the Styles API
  with a `mapbox://` style URL pointing to a v8 style, e.g. `mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v8`.
* The v8 satellite style (`mapbox://styles/mapbox/satellite-v8`) is now a plain satellite style, and not longer supports labels
  or contour lines via classes. For a labeled satellite style, use `mapbox://styles/mapbox/satellite-hybrid`.

* Removed `mbgl.config.HTTP_URL` and `mbgl.config.FORCE_HTTPS`; https is always used when connecting to the Mapbox API.
* Renamed `mbgl.config.HTTPS_URL` to `mbgl.config.API_URL`.

#### Bugfixes

* Don't draw halo when halo-width is 0 (#1381)
* Reverted shader changes that degraded performance on IE

#### API Improvements

* You can now unset layout and paint properties via the `setLayoutProperty` and `setPaintProperty` APIs
  by passing `undefined` as a property value.
* The `layer` option of `featuresAt` now supports an array of layers.

## 0.9.0 (Jul 29 2015)

* `glyphs` URL now normalizes without the `/v4/` prefix for `mapbox://` urls. Legacy behavior for `mapbox://fontstacks` is still maintained (#1385)
* Expose `geojson-vt` options for GeoJSON sources (#1271)
* bearing snaps to "North" within a tolerance of 7 degrees (#1059)
* Now you can directly mutate the minzoom and maxzoom layer properties with `map.setLayerZoomRange(layerId, minzoom, maxzoom)`
* Exposed `mapboxgl.Control`, a base class used by all UI controls
* Refactored handlers to be individually included in Map options, or enable/disable them individually at runtime, e.g. `map.scrollZoom.disable()`.
* New feature: Batch operations can now be done at once, improving performance for calling multiple style functions: (#1352)

  ```js
  style.batch(function(s) {
      s.addLayer({ id: 'first', type: 'symbol', source: 'streets' });
      s.addLayer({ id: 'second', type: 'symbol', source: 'streets' });
      s.addLayer({ id: 'third', type: 'symbol', source: 'terrain' });
      s.setPaintProperty('first', 'text-color', 'black');
      s.setPaintProperty('first', 'text-halo-color', 'white');
  });

## 0.8.1 (Jun 16 2015)

* No code changes; released only to correct a build issue in 0.8.0.

## 0.8.0 (Jun 15 2015)

#### Breaking changes

* `map.setView(latlng, zoom, bearing)` has been removed. Use
  [`map.jumpTo(options)`](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#map/jumpto) instead:

  ```js
  map.setView([40, -74.50], 9) // 0.7.0 or earlier
  map.jumpTo({center: [40, -74.50], zoom: 9}); // now
  ```
* [`map.easeTo`](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#map/easeto) and
  [`map.flyTo`](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#map/flyto) now accept a single
  options object rather than positional parameters:

  ```js
  map.easeTo([40, -74.50], 9, null, {duration: 400}); // 0.7.0 or earlier
  map.easeTo({center: [40, -74.50], zoom: 9, duration: 400}); // now
  ```
* `mapboxgl.Source` is no longer exported. Use `map.addSource()` instead. See the
  [GeoJSON line](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/geojson-line/) or
  [GeoJSON markers](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/geojson-markers/)
  examples.
* `mapboxgl.util.supported()` moved to [`mapboxgl.supported()`](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#mapboxgl/supported).
