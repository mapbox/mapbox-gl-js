Copyright (c) 2020, Mapbox

All rights reserved.

Mapbox gl-js version 2.0 or higher (“Mapbox Web SDK”) must be used according to
the Mapbox Terms of Service. This license allows developers with a current active
Mapbox account to use and modify the Mapbox Web SDK. Developers may modify the
Mapbox Web SDK code so long as the modifications do not change or interfere with
marked portions of the code related to billing, accounting, and anonymized data
collection. The Mapbox Web SDK only sends anonymized usage data, which Mapbox uses
for fixing bugs and errors, accounting, and generating aggregated anonymized
statistics. This license terminates automatically if a user no longer has an
active Mapbox account.

For the full license terms, please see the Mapbox Terms of Service at
